:rocket: Welcome to the <b>`Map-2(Week-1):RTL DESIGN, SYNTHESIS, FUNCTIONAL AND GLS VERIFICATION , OPTIMIZATION` </b> gameplay report of the <b> RISC-V SoC Tapeout EdTech Game </b> :video_game:.It is a 5 day journey and reported in a day by day manner.Each day is represented as level and there are some objectives in each level.Objectives are of two types-

- :book: <b>Learning Objective --></b> Summary of theory learned from video lectures.
- :dart: <b>Practical Objective --></b> Labs as instruced in video lectures.
