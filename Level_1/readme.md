## :book: Introduction to iverilog simulator

### :bulb: Simulator
   - RTL design is checked for matching with the specification by simulating the design.
   - The tool used for `simulating the design` is known as `simulator`.
   - `Icarus Verilog (iverilog)` is an example of simulator.
 
---
### :bulb: Design
   - Design is the actual verilog code or set of verilog codes which has the intended functionality to meet with the required specification.
   - Written in hardware description language (HDL) like Verilog.
   - Functional verification is used to validate the RTL design.
---
### :bulb: Testbench
   - Testbench is the setup to apply stimulus (test_vectors) to the design to check its functionality.
